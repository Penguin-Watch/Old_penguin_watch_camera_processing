Camera methodology

Automate nest detection (number of groups for k-means)

	Consensus:
	a) remove points outside of image space
	b) run k-means, k = max number of individual user clicks
	c) if cluster contains points from <3 users, discard those points
	d) recalculate max number of clicks
	e) run k-means using new click max
	NOW HAVE CONSENSUS

	Nest locations:
	f) use consensus clicks through time to look at click density
	g) threshold for clicks density
	h) find center of each of these polygons - these are nest locations
	NOW HAVE NEST LOCATIONS

	Create time series:
	a) use nest locations to create voronoi tessellation
	b) find which consensus clicks are in voronoi 'nest polygons'
	c) create time series for adults, chicks, eggs for each site camera
	NOW HAVE TIME SERIES

	Determine creche time:
	a1) nearest neighbor distance OR
	a2) determine when moving average of point distance from mean increases significantly

	Build mark-recapture model:
	a) time series of chicks for each nest
