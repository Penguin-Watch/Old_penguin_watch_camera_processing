Penguin Watch camera processing - Summer 2016

`Scripts/Methods_script.R` contains code to create time series from nests. It orthorectifies images, filters based on click density, and defines nests using K-means. Slow to run and parameters need to be tweaked for each site. Data produced seen below, with colored dotes over each nest. Green dots represent all clicks. Black lines represent 'nest zones'.
