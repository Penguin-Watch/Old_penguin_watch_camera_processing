#build user interface to mask out areas of interest and click nests
-Shiny
-Python

#nearest neighbor distance for points to get settlement
-points that have low nearest neighbor distance could also be used for density thresholding for nest detection

#test other sites and look at:
-ortho-rectification parameter
-density threshold parameter
-Look at run time for k-means



#Put everything into functions:
-renaming and things (pre-zooniverse)
-creating nest time series (post-zooniverse)


Link nest numbers from foraging and phenology cameras



Bio-loging
-trying to id nests in one image and id nests across images
-turn into something biologically meaningful
-people have done this manually - visits to colony, cameras but annotated manually

-used zooniverse crowdsourcing to get people to annotate
-how do we id **features of interest** (i.e., nest time series for survival) over time
-extracting parameters from this using mark recapture models




Data:
-consensus clicks for all cameras
-images for sites...might be large
